# Privacy Policy

## Reformuk(northcornwall) Privacy Policy
reformuk-northcornwall.com has a commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information. Personal information is information that would identify you, or from which you can be identified. It is important to us to protect your personal information. We don’t give it away or sell it and we have systems in place to protect it.

## Collection
We collect personal information about you when you give it to us, usually when you complete one of our forms, whether hard copy or online. We don’t collect your information from anywhere or anyone else.

We may also use ‘cookies’ so that you can customize our web pages or so that you do not have to keep filling in your details repeatedly. If you want to find out more about ‘cookies’ and how they work, we suggest that you look up Wikipedia.

## Use
We use your personal information to provide you with our services and in an effort to tailor your experience of our products and services specifically for you.

## Disclosure
We don’t give away or sell your personal information. We will disclose your personal information if we are legally compelled to. Your personal information has been collected by a business and if that business is ever sold in the future, your personal information may be passed to the new owner.

We might use another provider to deliver our products or services to you. If they need your personal information to complete that delivery we will require them to use your information only for that purpose and then destroy it.

## Links and Public Forums
We have no control over the information accessed through links from our site. You use links at your own risk.

If you post your personal information in a membership blog or public forum, we have no control over how it is used and no responsibility to protect it for you.


## Emails
If you have received a mailing from us then your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future (“opt-in”), or you have previously purchased or expressed interest in our products or services.

We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.

Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us, or to change your details. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email.

## Update
You can update your details via our subscription facility or by contacting us.

## Feedback or Complaints
Let us know if you have a problem or feedback by contacting us. We will take action to fix any problems, within reason. We will update this policy from time to time to meet our legal obligations.
