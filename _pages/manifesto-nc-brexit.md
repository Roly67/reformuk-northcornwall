Many people that voted for Brexit in 2016 believe that Brexit has not been
delivered.

## Top 5 Reasons Why We Care About a Real Brexit in North Cornwall

1. North Cornwall voted to leave the European Union (EU) in 2016 with a vote
share of more than 60%.
2. Farming is a significant industry in North Cornwall. Hard working farmers
need reductions in red tape that has its origins in anti competitive EU
legislation designed to "level the playing field" across all EU nations.
3. EU imposed employment law is still in force making it harder and more
expensive for businesses in North Cornwall to find, hire and retain staff. This
is a particular problem in the important hospitality and tourist sectors in 
our county.
4. The Brexit deal that the UK agreed with the EU turns its back on the UK
fishing industry. Cornwall cares about its fishing industry.
5. By freeing ourselves from the shackles of over done EU regulation, North
Cornwall businesses and residents can seize the opportunities of being happy
and productive to serve the needs of both the visitors and local businesses.

## My Position on Brexit
If elected as your parliamentary representative, I will work with my colleagues
in Reform UK to seek out support from other MPs who also believe that the
existing Brexit in Name Only (BRiNO) is not good enough for the hard working,
decent people of the UK who simply wish to be left alone, unburdened from 
rules and laws made in Brussels that have no value to their lives of livelihoods
and indeed end up costing us all more in taxation and wasting needless time in 
compliance issues that serve no one except the EU.
