## Your Local Potential Parliamentary Candidate - Rowland O'Connor

![Rowland O'Connor][Rowland O'Connor]{: .align-center}

### Why I am standing
I am not a politician or, until recently, had any desire to be in politics.
However, having observed the complete and unmitigated mess that our various 
elected representatives and political parties have made of our once beautiful
United Kingdom, I felt that I could no longer just sit on the side lines and
complain.

As a brief summary, here is where our country is in 2023:

* Out of control, illegal migration occurring in the tens of thousands annually 
 which our Government seems unable or unwilling to do anything about. We, the
 taxpayers, are paying millions of pounds daily to house and sustain these alleged
 "refugees". (France, the last point of origin for many claimants, is a safe country)
* A public healthcare system with a current backlog exceeding 7.4 million patients.
* Strikes in public sector rivalling those last seen in the 1970's.
* Out of control inflation (with no plan from the Bank of England) that is
making many citizens of the UK net poorer and unable in some cases to pay 
for essentials such as accommodation, food and energy.
* Net zero policies being forced on us that no one voted for. These net zero
policies are trickle down policies originating from unelected, global
organisations such as the United Nations and World Economic Forum. We are
all paying for these "initiatives" via our income tax and via levies imposed
as part of our utility bills. We are all certainly getting net poorer for benefits
to our environment and world that are questionable at best and very likely
economically damaging to current and future generations.
* The highest taxation burden in 70 years combined with a progressive
deterioration in the quality and availability of our vital public services.
* A general distrust in our political system following various scandals including 
expenses, "partygate", inappropriate and sometime illegal activities and so on.
Faith in our politicians is perhaps at an all time low.

It is for these reasons together with many more that I feel obliged to 
pay down my debt to this wonderful country and the opportunities and freedom
that it has afforded me over many decades when we had a fairer, more equal 
society where basic human values such as respect, decency and moral integrity 
meant something.

Therefore, I stand in North Cornwall - my home as your potential Parliamentary
representative and voice for decency, honesty and truth.


## Bio

### Personal
I live in North Cornwall, am married to a wonderful woman that is a saint 
for putting up with my various "projects" over the years.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, walking our dogs
and working out at our local sports centre.

My core belief are:

* Fairness
* Respect for differing opinions and the need to be able to have open discussion
(no subjects off limits)
* Moral integrity
* Traditional family values
* Fair pay for a fair days work
* The state works for us (not the other way around)


### Early years
My ancestors (grand parents and great grand parents) were politically active
in supporting equal rights for women as well as being involved in lobbying
for the creation of the National Health Service. As staunch lifelong Labour
(as it was many decades ago) voters my ancestors believed in equality,
freedom and fairness for the working classes at the time.

I was born in the late 1960's in London. My father owned and ran a building and 
construction company. As a teenager, I worked for my father on several
construction sites as a young pair of helping hands
(i.e. manual, unskilled labour). It was this early experience with the hard,
manual work in my fathers company that installed a crucial life belief in me
that I hold dear to this day: "Fair pay for a fair days work".

I have (since the age of about 3) been interested and reasonably
proficient at engineering. I love to solve problems and find solutions.

### Career
I graduated from Kingston University in 1988 with a degree in Electrical
and Electronic Engineering.

Since 1998, my career has included some fantastic opportunities
working in industries ranging from heavy electrical through to retail, 
investment banking, luxury yachts and even a spell as a professional SCUBA diving
instructor! I feel truly grateful for the wide range of experiences, opportunities
and the wonderful people that I had the pleasure of working with over the years.

After deciding to create my own online company in the early 2000's, I have 
been involved with various ventures including building and marketing
various successful online information services.

In 2020, my company was extremely proud, honoured and humbled to accept 
The Queens Award for Innovation from her late Majesty. This prestigious
award was for innovation in UK digital services and is thanks to the 
great team that helped build our company between 2013 and 2020.

### Today
From 2020 onwards, as a direct result of the impact of questionable covid 
(mis?) management from central Government and its impact on businesses
and individuals (lives and livelihoods), I became increasingly concerned
that our basic human rights and civil liberties were at risk from
a Government that seemed not only to be drunk on emergency powers but also
not following its own rules. Some of the behaviours of those elected to serve
us, the people, I find to be unacceptable, inappropriate and, in many cases,
uncaring. In good conscience, I therefore feel obliged to stand to representation
those that may feel similarly. Never again can we allow a situation where
a majority government (and the "opposition") sacrificed democracy, decency and 
open debate on the alter of "safety" without having the opportunity to debate,
discuss and scrutinise issues from a wide and diverse range of experts
and opinions.

As you Potential Parliamentary Candidate for North Cornwall, I offer you a 
range of true conservative thoughts and policies that you may not see being
offered from main stream parties (e.g. Conservative, Labour, Lib Dem).
