## Your Parliamentary Candidate for North Cornwall - Rowland O'Connor

![Rowland O'Connor][Rowland O'Connor]{: .align-left}

[&lt;-click for hi-res version][3]

I am not a career politician and have no desire or incentive to become one.

My political home has traditionally been the Conservative Party for many decades.
In 2019, I voted Conservative and donated to the local election fighting fund.
However, in the light of the shock and horror of what's happened since 2019, I 
will never vote for or support the Conservative Party again. The Conservative Party
has abandoned my values and beliefs as it shifts(is dragged by 'one nation' liberal Tory MPs)
towards being 'Labour 2.0' and blatantly and obviously being complicit
in forming the undemocratic uni party blob. The Conservative Party has failed
its members, donors and our United Kingdom. As Labour 2.0, where is the opposition
in Parliamentary process?

My family and I have lived in North Cornwall since 2008. It is our home and it
is worth fighting for.

I am a graduate in engineering and have had a broad range of experience in 
senior leadership positions in engineering, software, consulting, retail,
investment banking and manufacturing. In 2010 I started a business here in
North Cornwall which, in 2020, it was am immense privilege for our company to
receive the Queens Award for innovation for creating the worlds first cloud
based pre-fraud solution based on email address data.

![SCUBA][5]{: .align-left}
My career has been diverse. As well as my achievements in the business world, I
have been a SCUBA instructor working in the industry for many years. It was my
priviledge to have taught BBC wildlife presenter [Iolo Williams][Iolo Williams]
to dive and to cerify him as a PADI diver.

I am standing to be your MP for North Cornwall because I could see the 
incompetence and the lack of leadership from our Parliamentary MPs during COVID. 
The incompetence is still costing our children, communities and businesses
dearly and it can never happen again.
To take action, I decided to join Reform UK to offer a choice other than the
legacy two party system.

I believe in preserving our freedoms and having honest, intelligent MPs and
councillors. We need to restore faith in our local and national politics.

![Meeting][6]{: .align-right}
As a local businessman I have decided to stand up for the politically lost in 
North Cornwall and try to save our country from ruin before it's too late.

Fundamentally, I believe that our sovereign rights as individuals to make our own
decisions is paramount to government or state intervention and mandates. Our
government and local authorities exist to serve us, the citizens of the United
Kingdom and not the other way around as many in authority seem to believe.

The other tired old political parties will continue to ignore your views and 
let you down. The election is no different. So let's send Westminster a clear
message and vote **Reform UK** this time around.

# I promise to:

* Protect **national borders** from illegal migration. Pick up migrants out of
boats and take them back to France.

* Deal with the **cost of living crisis** - raise the minimum tax threshold to
£20,000. Scrap the VAT on energy bills. Lower fuel duty by 20p per litre. Scrap
environmental levies.

* **Immediate deportation for foreign criminals**. Deport foreign nationals
immediately after their prison sentence ends. Withdraw citizenship from
immigrants who commit significant crime.

* **Cancel Net Zero** saving us up to £1 trillion. Invest in more sustainable,
natural alternatives to promote the environment.

* **Support local farmers** by cutting imports, ending net zero quotas and 
preserving farm land for food.

* **Implement Brexit properly** which includes taking back full fishing rights
and cutting red tape originally set out by the EU.
