## Say No to The World Economic Forum
[The World Economic Forum (WEF)][1] is an unelected body of wealthy and
influential individuals that believe they know what is best for the rest of
humanity.

With representatives from decision makers in big business, finance and
politics, the WEF steers policies and finance that affects all of our lives.
These decisions and the consequences are made without our consent and generally
without political debate or scrutiny.

The WEF is the exact opposite of democracy and is accountable to no one. It might
be suggested that the WEF is a prime example of what happens when there is 
no democratic oversight or accountability in that many describe the WEF in terms 
that include:

* Technocracy
* Tyranny

## Klaus Schwab
![Klaus_Schwab][ks]

There is much written about [Klaus Schwab][2], the founder of WEF. There is 
sufficient cause for concern that Mr. Schwab has been directly, and via his WEF,
been involved in the capture of democratic structures and institutions.

Many of our own members of parliament are known to be actively associated with
WEF and Mr. Schwab.
