# Supporting Cornish Tourism
Tourism is the biggest economic sector in Cornwall. It is a vital source of
employment and income for the region.

Interesting facts about tourism in Cornwall:

* It accounts for at least one in five jobs in Cornwall.
* Over four million people every year come to Cornwall for tourism.
* Growth in tourism to Cornwall is projected to grow at 3.8 percent per year
through to 2025.

However, Cornwall can do better and make more of its tourism industry. To help
our County to not only survive but to also thrive, there are some challenges
that we need to recognise:

## Top 5 Challenges for Cornwall Tourism in 2023

1. Reducing pool of skilled and unskilled workers makes recruitment difficult.
2. Increasing number of 'hard to fill' posts, particularly in catering.
3. Transport issues result in problems for local residents getting to places
of employment.
4. Lack of child care provision is a problem for some local residents wishing
to go to work.
5. Lack of opportunity for training and further education is a problem for
local residents as well as a possible barrier for attracting skilled workers
from areas outside of Cornwall.

Local and national authorities can and must help to provide the environment
and conditions to support the tourism industry in North Cornwall.


## Mission Statement
As your MP for North Cornwall, I will place a priority on lobbying for measures
to support tourism in North Cornwall. This will include:

* Identification and removal of as much 'red tape' as possible. 'Red tape' is
unhelpful to most businesses.
* Make sure that any existing support (e.g. access to possible grants and loans
) is better publicised to those who will benefit from access to support (i.e. 
employers and workers).
* See what can be done from national government to prioritise allocation of
support funding to Cornwall for better transport, child care and further
education.
