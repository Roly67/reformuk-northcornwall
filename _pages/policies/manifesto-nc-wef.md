# Say No to The World Economic Forum
[The World Economic Forum (WEF)][1] is an unelected body of wealthy and
influential individuals that believe they know what is best for the rest of
humanity.

With representatives from decision makers in big business, finance and
politics, the WEF steers policies and finance that affects all of our lives.
These decisions and the consequences are made without our consent and generally
without political debate or scrutiny.

Some examples of significant impacts on our lives as a direct result of WEF
driving policies are:

1. Net Zero. Increased taxation and energy prices for us all in order to meet
objectives stated in [Agenda 2030][4] together with the relentless push us all
to buy expensive Electric Vehicles (EVs).
2. [The Great Reset][3]. "You will own nothing and be happy" 

The WEF is the exact opposite of democracy and is accountable to no one. It might
be suggested that the WEF is a prime example of what happens when there is 
no democratic oversight or accountability in that many describe the WEF in terms 
that include:

* Technocracy
* Tyranny

## Klaus Schwab
![Klaus_Schwab][ks]{: .align-center}

There is much written about [Klaus Schwab][2], the founder of WEF. There is 
sufficient cause for concern that Mr. Schwab has been directly, and via his WEF,
been involved in the capture of democratic structures and institutions.

Many of our own members of parliament are known to be actively associated with
WEF and Mr. Schwab.

## Top 5 Reasons Why We Care About WEF Influence in North Cornwall
1. As expressed in the 2016 EU referendum, North Cornwall wants its freedom and 
autonomy from centralist big governance. This includes federated organisations 
such as the EU but also from globalist unelected bodies such as the WEF.
2. One of North Cornwall's significant industries is farming. Farmers want
to be left alone to work to create food, dairy and meat produce to sustain us all.
The last thing that farmers need or want is yet more legislation and boxes to tick
particularly where this originates from opaque, unaccountable globalist elite
forums.
3. WEF policies include various suggestions that would restrict travel and mobility
such as "15 minute cities" and the progressive pushing of personal powered transportation
out of the reach of many of our hard working population (e.g. think expensive EVs 
and the removal of Petrol and diesel cars by 2030s). This will be disastrous for 
Cornwall in terms of its tourist industry and associated businesses.
4. WEF not only drives policies on its "green" obsession but also is a major
influencer in creating investment products (via [BlackRock ESG funds][5]) that
will restrict inbound investment to Cornwall based on an arbitrary set of 
criteria determined by WEF and other unaccountable globalist institutions.
5. The objectives of the WEF (e.g. centralist control of issues ranging from your
finances, freedoms and health) do not necessarily align with the freedoms that
every UK citizen is entitled to as a birthright of living in a free democracy.
This is as true for North Cornwall as it is for each and every citizen of the UK.

## My Position on WEF
I do not support and refuse to be associated with WEF.
It is also Reform UK policy to have nothing to do with WEF.
As your parliamentary candidate, if elected, I would identify and strongly work to
remove any existing WEF influence to North Cornwall and would be accountable to
my constituents to do so.
