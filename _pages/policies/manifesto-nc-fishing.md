## Top 5 Reasons Why You Should Care About UK Fishing Industry

1. UK Government has ceded fishing rights, our sovereign nautical territory and our fish to the European Union (EU).
2. UK fishing could be worth up to £6Billion and provide a significant boost to jobs and our economy.
3. For every one job at sea, another 8 high paid jobs are needed on shore.
4. Of the total quota of fish processed and consumed within the EU
80% are fished from UK waters.
5. UK Government has issued at least 130 "free of charge" licenses to France. UK fishing boats must pay
between £80k - £100k for a fishing license. This is a blatant slap in the face for UK fisherman from a Conservative
government that has consistently been anti UK fishing since 1973.


## Supporting Cornish Fishing
The fishing industry in the UK has been utterly decimated since Ted Heath's Conservative government gave away our
fishing rights more than 40 years ago when we joined the European Union on 1 January 1973.

The United Kingdom is an island that is surrounded by some of the richest fishing grounds in the world. This
abundance is extremely lucrative and this is why the European Union (EU) is interested in exploiting our
sovereign waters.

Time and time again, UK Government has let down our coastal communities by sacrificing our fishing industry
to other national service industries such as banking and finance.
By denying those communities reasonable access and quotas to our own sovereign waters, coastal communities which once thrived
due to the fishing industry have been left deserted, hopeless and depressed.

With the current government policies of sacrificing our natural resources to overseas interests, not only are
we sleepwalking into more resource crisis but also risking our own national food security.

Fish around our coastlines are an asset worth billions of pounds per year to our national economy.
This asset is owned by each and every UK citizen. Can you remember ever being asked whether you were happy
with giving our assets and wealth away to third parties, I certainly can't?

Currently, there are 186 coastal constituencies in the UK. Interestingly, during Brexit, all 186 MPs
representing coastal constituents voted for the disastrous "oven ready" Brexit deal that continued to cede
fishing access and rights from UK fishing industry to the EU.

Reform UK strongly believes that our own national resources must be used, first and foremost, to secure the prosperity
and well-being of our nation.


## Mission Statement
Bringing our fishing industry back to the people of the UK is long over due. If elected as your MP for Reform UK,
I will commit to investigating what can be done, if anything, to encourage expansion of commercial fishing in Newquay,
Bossiney and Boscastle.

On a national level, I will work to support our Reform UK colleagues to make the changes necessary to bring our
fishing wealth back to the UK.
