## An Honest Debate on Climate Change
It is important to be able to debate and discuss issues such as climate change,
rather than face the smears and cancellation threats that spread throughout
public life.

Reform UK fully accepts that climate change is real, after all it has happened
for millions of years based on multiple factors completely outside human
control or influence. Warming has of course taken place over the last
approximately 150 years, with signs over recent years that it is now leveling
off. Humans have had an impact on this global warming,though scientists
disagree as to how much. Those who think that getting to Net Zero will stop
climate change are in fact just denying reality. Even the IPCCâ€™s latest
assessment report admits that if we get to Net Zero, it would take another
200-1,000 years before sea levels stopped rising (hardly definitive in timing
but clearly a long way off!). So we would be better to adapt, by spending far
less money more wisely, for example on sea level defences where needed. This
is more sensible than wasting trillions of pounds trying to stop climate
change, when it has always changed and always will change.

There is plenty of climate good news that you will not hear on mainstream news
outlets who wish to preach doom and gloom such as:

* The Great Barrier Reef has seen coral cover return to record levels just five
years after the consensus of climate experts said it was permanently damaged
beyond recovery.
* Extreme weather events have always occurred, but thanks to human adaptation
and ingenuity, result in some 96% fewer deaths per year than 100 years ago. 
* The earth has increased in greenery over the last 30 years, partly thanks
to higher CO2 levels. CO2 is a natural fertiliser, which is essential to
plant life via photosynthesis, and without plants humans could not exist!
* The Arctic sea ice cover has increased since a low point in 2012 and is very
close to 30 year average levels.
* Overall sea ice cover in Antarctica has not declined in recent decades.
* Polar bear numbers in the Arctic are increasing, not decreasing.

## Ultra Low Emission Zones (ULEZ)
Reform UK does not support ULEZ. As your elected parliamentary representative, 
I will strongly oppose ULEZ both within North Cornwall and nationally.
